One of the most difficult aspects of operating a fitness business is attracting new members and clients. Our mission at healthclubs.net is to provide you with quality health club and personal training membership leads.</p> 

<p>
The first generation of this site was built in 2005 as the health club network, one of the first online directories for fitness centers and professionals. We created it after managing the online marketing campaigns for multiple health clubs and fitness clients.

<p>
I knew there had to be an easier way for clubs to gain new members that didn't require a lot of their time, delivered quality lead prospects and was most of all, affordable. I think we have truly built a world class marketing platform for the fitness industry. We will continue to innovate and help you meet your membership goals.
