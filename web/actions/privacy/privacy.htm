<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><?= APP_TITLE ?>&nbsp;strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet
technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience.
We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail
address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this
privacy policy.&nbsp;
</p>

<p><b>How we gather information from users</b></p>

<p>
How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting,
the activities in which you elect to participate and the services
provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you
register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain
features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may
provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests,
message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site.
Like most Web sites, <?= APP_TITLE ?> also collects
information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that
may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of
your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize
you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the
cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having
to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the
number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting
our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather
information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not
to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to
refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access
certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name
and password, and we may not be able to customize the site&rsquo;s
features according to your preferences.
</p>

<p><b>What we do with the information we collect</b></p>

<p>
Like
other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and
deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your
privacy and do not share your information with anyone.<br /><br />Aggregated
Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be
used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your
usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to
help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are
visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated
Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and
business partners. Again, this information does not include any
Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to
identify you individually.
</p>

<p>
We may use Personally
Identifiable Information collected on <?= APP_TITLE ?> to
communicate with you about your registration and customization
preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and
products offered by <?= APP_TITLE ?> and other topics we
think you might find of interest. 
</p>

<p>
Personally Identifiable
Information collected by <?= APP_TITLE ?> may also be used
for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration,
troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration
of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain
third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our
site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information.
We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition,
from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell,
buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such
transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We
may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at
other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law,
in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or
to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or
necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to
disclosure in such cases.
</p>

<p><b>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</b></p>

<p>
<?= APP_TITLE ?>&nbsp;expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy
of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our
partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers
accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data
collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to
our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a <?= APP_TITLE ?> page, certain content that is actually
created or hosted by a third party. Also, through <?= APP_TITLE ?> you may be introduced to, or be able to
access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes
offered by other parties. <?= APP_TITLE ?> is not
responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You
should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties
when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third
party.
</p>

<p>
While on our site, our advertisers, promotional
partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to
attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information
about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third
parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine
whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features
available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and
may use cookies or other technology to gather information. <?= APP_TITLE ?> does not control the use of this technology
by third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible
for any actions or policies of such third parties.
</p>

<p>
You
should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally
Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that
information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by
third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited
messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are
beyond the control of <?= APP_TITLE ?> and this policy.
</p>

page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following
the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those

will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time
the information was collected.

This
policy and the use of this Site are governed by <?= STATE ?> law. If a
